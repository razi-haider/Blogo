# Deploy BlogO into Local Server
Following is the roadmap to deploy this project into local server:

### **Pre-Requisites:**
- Node.js should be installed. You can download it from 
https://nodejs.org/
- A text editor or IDE such as VSCode or Atom

### **Steps:**
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone <repo url> 
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <project directory>
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install 
```

4. Start the server:
```
npm start
```

5. By running the command in step 4, it will give you a link (http://localhost:3000). You can click on that to directly redirect into the website.
